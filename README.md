Fingerprint is primarily a command line tool to compare directory structures on 
disk. It also provides a programmatic interface for this procedure.

Because Fingerprint produces output to +IO+ like structures, it is easy to transmit
this data across a network, or store it for later use. As an example, it could be
used to check the integrity of a backup.

For examples please see the main Fingerprint page <http://www.oriontransfer.co.nz/projects/admin-toolbox/fingerprint>.
